## AWS

Welcome to my AWS repository, here I have created how to setup you AWS to get it running without any hassle and I have created useful script that can be used to faster test your template by easing the process of stack creation from comfort of your terminal and deleting your stack. Click this links to go to the appropriate locations.

- [Cloudformation Templates](/tree/master/cloudformation-templates) - cloudformation templates to get your infrastructure running fast
- [AWS Setup](tree/master/aws-setup) - easily get your new work station ready to use aws cli with vscode.
- [Stack Scripts](tree/master/stack-scripts) - reduce unnecessary steps when testing or creating your stacks or deleting your stacks
